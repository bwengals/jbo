# How to start

0. Need to do this just once after `git pull`.  Install application
dependencies in `jbo` directory (where you see 'packages.json'):

	npm install

1. Start it up:

	npm start

2. In browser go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) (not 0.0.0.0, must be called 'localhost' for webrtc to work).
